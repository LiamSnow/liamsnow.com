# Why
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is really a revolutionary tool
and got me into smart home stuff in the first place. You can really do so much
more with Home Assistant than other smart home platform. Furthermore, it can
connect just about any smart home product.

BUT it gets on my nerves all the time:
 1. **Clunky and Poorly Designed UI**: the organization system of the UI is confusing. I find myself having to click into 6 different subpages for simple things.
 2. **Constantly Breaking**: Just leaving Home Assistant running on its own, it will eventually just break itself and require manual intervention.
 3. **Mixing of GUI and YAML Configuration**: The configuration system just seems like a mess of tech debt. Editing in the UI should be easy but doesnt give you all the features and is consistently buggy. Then when you try to edit in YAML is a mess of digging through documentation.
 4. **Slow Website**
